This project was created with the objecive of making a website that allows you to take an autism screening quiz and give you a primitive diagnosis on whether you have autism or not. It is strictly not a medically acclimated quiz.

Problem Statement:
Autism spectrum disorder is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave.
People with autism have a wide range of symptoms, which can include differences in social and communication behaviors, intellectual disabilities, and other physical and mental health conditions. People with autism also have a wide range of health care and service needs. Research shows that access to needed services and supports early in life can promote people’s health and well-being over the long term.Millions of people navigate life undiagnosed, struggling with social and sensory challenges without the support they deserve. Access to autism diagnosis is often limited by financial constraints, long wait times, and societal stigma, leaving many—especially adults—without clarity.

Solution:
This Autism Screening Quiz provides a simple, stigma-free, and accessible way for individuals to gain insights into their neurodivergence. While not a medical diagnosis, it serves as a first step toward self-awareness, encouraging those who resonate with the results to seek professional guidance. Everyone deserves the chance to understand themselves better.
